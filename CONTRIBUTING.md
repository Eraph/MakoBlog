# Contributing to MakoBlog

Thanks for showing interest in my wee project! It's nothing major yet, I just wanted to have a go at making a snappy blog using Angular. The intention is not to make the next WordPress, just a blog that blogs well. That said, I would like to see the following "advanced" features eventually (and I'll need some help with these so you're welcome to chip in):

- Support for a variety of back-ends (will be focusing purely on .NET Core WebAPI for now)
- Support for a variety of storage solutions (Entity Framework should help with that, at least for the .NET Core solution)
- Theming, this is on top of some basic SASS editing I want to provide

## Raising Issues

Use the *Issues* tab and get adding. Check for duplicates first, of course!

## Starting Tasks

Check the *Projects* tab to see if any projects have been started for what you want to get making, and if there is one, be sure to assign it. If there's not, feel free to add a Project.

## Contributing Code

Create a new branch, get coding, check in, submit pull request. Code commits should not go directly into the `master` branch.
