# MakoBlog
An SPA blog with a ASP.NET Core WebAPI backend and an Angular 7 front-end.

## Philosophy
### Simplicity
It's a blog, not a CMS. Will have support for core blogging functionality including RSS, an externally accessible API, and customisable user profiles. With that said...

### Extensibility
Additional features should be easy to add, allowing administrators to customise their blog as they see fit.

### Customisability
Support for themes and straight-forward tweaking of CSS files to style the blog.

### Usability
A combination of Angular, Angular Material, and responsive design will ensure that MakoBlog is snappy, intuitive and usable on a range of devices.

### Configurability
The front-end should not be dependent on a certain backend. MakoBlog will be built with a .NET Core backend initially, but the front and back ends will be separated to allow other technologies to provide the backend. Furthermore, it should not be tied to any particular database.

## Prerequisites
